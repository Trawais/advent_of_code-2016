# advent_of_code-2016

## Requirements
* `ruby` in desired version (see the `.ruby-version` file)
  * Note: I recommend to have ruby installed via rbenv or rvm
  * Note_2: If your choice is rbenv, don't forget to call `rbenv rehash` after installing all gems
* `bundler`
* `rubocop` for code-style analysis

## How to build
`bundle install`

## How to run
* Go to folder with the particular task
* Run `rspec` in the folder
* All tasks are solved as "unit tests" including all examples for debugging
